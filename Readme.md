# Predicting Brain Weight Based on Head Size Using Linear Regression

## Overview

This repository contains Python code for building a linear regression model to predict brain weight based on head size. Linear regression is a simple and widely used machine learning algorithm for predicting a continuous variable based on one or more predictor variables.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model includes measurements of head size (in cubic centimeters) and the corresponding brain weight (in grams). This dataset is commonly used for educational purposes and can be found in various statistical and machine learning resources.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-weight-prediction.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd brain-weight-prediction

3. Run the linear_regression_brain_weight.py script:

    ```bash
    python linear_regression_brain_weight.py

This script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, train the linear regression model, and evaluate its performance.
